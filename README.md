## Current Project Status
The current project status consists of a working prototype which meets the following requirements:

### Greenhouse Structure
1. Enclosure for a plant no larger than 2m x 1m x 1m
2. Walls should be transparent to allow light in
3. Can be opened easily for maintenance and watering
4. Plants can be removed from greenhouse if desired without assistance
5. Transportable by an adult
6. Stable against wind of 39-46 mph
7. Able to withstand rain and snow without damage to plants or electronics
8. Automatically maintains a suitable range of temperature during New England winter. Heating must be automatic, but any need for cooling can be performed manually by use. Ideal temperature range can be set by the user via the web application
9. Has sensors mesasuring temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, and power consumption
10. Sensor data is sent to web application over user's WiFi network
11. Works using one standard North American wall outlet (110-120V AC)

### Web Application
1. Displays all current sensor readings within the greenhouse
2. User can set ideal temperature range
3. Notifiations are sent to user if greenhouse is outside of ideal temperature range


These requirements have been met and the mechanisms for meeting them are described in more detail in [README_HARDWARE.md](Hardware/README_HARDWARE.md) and [README_SOFTWARE.md](Software/README_SOFTWARE.md)
