## External Structure
The external structure of the greenhouse is has two main components: the wooden base and the PVC pipe frame. The wooden base was created by screwing together treated cedar lumber boards to create the sides of the box. These were then screwed into one piece of plywood which created the floor of the box. To make transportation of the greenhouse easier, wheels were attached to the bottom to allow the greenhouse to be rolled. The next component, the PVC pipe frame, was constructed by cutting pieces of pipe to their specified lengths and multiple differnt joints were used to connect these pieces together. A primer was then used to prepare the pipe to be cemented together. To secure the frame to the base, plastic blocks were machined to create holes large enough to securely hold the frame in. These blocks were then attached to the base using a multi-surface epoxy. After the frame was securely in place in the base, the polyethylene plastic was attached to the frame using PVC pipe clamps. Two layers of plastic were attached to the frame, an inner and an outer layer, to create an air gap which acts as an insullation layer. The door of the greenhouse was created using two-adhesive zippers placed into a backwards L shape. When both zippers are unzipped, it creates a flap in the polyethylene that can be pulled out creating a door to the interior of the greenhouse. All of the sketches and photographs pertaining to the external structure of the greenhouse are placed in the [External-Structure](External-Structure) folder.
